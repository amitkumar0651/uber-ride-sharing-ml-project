# House Price Prediction ML Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project predicts house prices using machine learning techniques. It demonstrates an end-to-end workflow from data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to model training, evaluation, and predictions. The goal is to estimate property prices based on features like location, size, number of rooms, and other factors.
